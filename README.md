# Out to Eat 

University of Iceland Software Engineering Project by Mikolaj, Valourie and Þröstur 
  
For this project we are building an app for those who are looking for a place to buy food, but don't know where to go. 
The app has a list of Icelandic restaurants and a matching game where a group of people can start a session together and find a place that suits everyone.
